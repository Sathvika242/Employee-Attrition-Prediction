# 📋 Employee Attrition Prediction
The Employee Attrition Prediction project focuses on analyzing employee data to determine the likelihood of an employee leaving an organization. Attrition, also known as employee turnover, is a major concern for companies as it directly affects productivity, hiring costs, and overall organizational stability. This project aims to build and compare multiple machine learning models that can predict attrition accurately based on various factors such as demographics, work experience, job satisfaction, and compensation. The models implemented include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective approach for predicting employee attrition.

The dataset used in this study is based on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, which contains detailed information about employees, including attributes like age, business travel frequency, department, distance from home, education level, environment satisfaction, gender, job involvement, job role, monthly income, overtime, performance rating, relationship satisfaction, total working years, and many others. The target column is “Attrition,” which indicates whether an employee has left the organization (Yes) or not (No). Before modeling, extensive data preprocessing was performed. This included cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary columns such as employee number and standard hours, handling missing and duplicate values, encoding categorical features like gender, department, and job role into numerical form using label encoding or one-hot encoding, and scaling numerical columns to ensure uniformity. The data was then split into training and testing sets, typically in an 80:20 ratio, to prepare it for model development and evaluation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to better understand the dataset and discover patterns influencing attrition. Several visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and count plots were created to explore distributions and relationships. The analysis revealed that younger employees, those who work overtime, and those with lower job satisfaction and poor work-life balance are more likely to leave the company. Correlation heatmaps helped identify relationships between features such as income, job level, and total working years. These insights helped refine the understanding of factors that drive attrition and informed the model selection and feature engineering process.

Three machine learning models were built and compared in this project. The first model, Logistic Regression, served as a baseline classifier due to its simplicity and interpretability. It provided insight into which variables most strongly influenced the probability of attrition. The second model, Random Forest Classifier, was implemented as an ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to capture non-linear relationships and reduce overfitting. The third and final model, XGBoost Classifier, used gradient boosting to sequentially improve predictions and achieve higher accuracy and robustness. Each model was trained and fine-tuned using relevant hyperparameters to optimize performance.
